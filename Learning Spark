Some stats: (KB > MB > GB > TB > PB)

Facebook daily logs: 60 TB
Google Web Index: 10+ PB

Time to read 1 TB data assuming disc speed is 100MB/s on single machine: 1* 1024 * 1024/100 =~ 10485 sec = 3 hrs

Spark : Computing framework
Spark components: Spark SQL, Spark streaming, MLib/ML, GraphX, Apache Spark
